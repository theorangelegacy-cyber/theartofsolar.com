const TITLE = "Solar Panel Removal Cost in Florida (2026 Prices)";
const DESC =
  "What it really costs to take solar panels off for a new roof in Florida and put them back: per-panel prices and what a fair quote includes.";

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does it cost to remove and reinstall solar panels in Florida?",
    a: "Most Florida homes land between $250 and $500 per panel for the full detach and reset, which puts a typical 20 to 30 panel system somewhere around $5,000 to $12,000. The spread is that wide because a single-story tile roof and a two-story tile roof are completely different jobs. The only number that means anything is the one written against your actual roof after somebody has counted the panels and looked at the rails.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is it priced per panel and not as one flat fee?",
    a: "Because panels are the unit of work. Each one gets unclipped, carried down, labelled, stored, carried back up, re-clipped and re-torqued. A 12-panel system is genuinely half the labour of a 24-panel system. Per-panel pricing is also the easiest way for you to compare two quotes honestly.",
  },
  {
    q: "What makes the price go up?",
    a: "Height and pitch first, because a steep two-story roof needs more fall protection and slows everything down. Then tile, which has to be lifted and re-set by hand and breaks if it is rushed. Then rail type, since some older racking cannot be reused and has to be replaced. Then access, because a crew that cannot get a lift or a ladder to the right side of the house loses hours. Battery systems and ground mounts are their own quote.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the permit included in the price?",
    a: "In our quotes, yes. Florida counties treat a reinstall as new work, so it needs a permit and an inspection. If a quote you are comparing does not mention the permit, ask, because it is either being left out of the price or being skipped altogether.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I pay for new mounts as well?",
    a: "Yes, and you want to. The old mounts belong to the old roof and they come off with it. Every attachment on the new roof should be new and flashed, or the roofer will not warranty the roof around them. Good quotes list the new attachments as a line item.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I just leave the panels on and roof around them?",
    a: "No. A roofer cannot lay a proper new roof under a live array, and most will not warranty a roof they could not fully tear off. Trying to work around the panels usually costs more than removing them, because it turns one clean job into a slow one.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will my insurance or the roofer pay for it?",
    a: "If the roof is being replaced on an insurance claim, the solar detach and reset is often a covered line item on that claim, because the panels have to move for the covered repair to happen. We write our quotes so they can be handed straight to an adjuster. Roofers almost never carry the cost themselves, but many will coordinate it.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does the whole thing take?",
    a: "Detach is usually one day. Then the roof happens on the roofer's schedule. Reinstall is usually one day once the roof passes its final inspection, plus the time it takes the county to inspect the solar side. Most homeowners are without production for a week or two, not a month.",
  },
];

const DRIVERS = [
  {
    h: "Panel count",
    p: "The main lever. Every panel is handled four times, so the count sets the labour more than anything else.",
  },
  {
    h: "Roof type",
    p: "Shingle is the baseline. Tile costs more because tiles are lifted and re-set by hand and break when rushed. Metal has its own attachment hardware.",
  },
  {
    h: "Height and pitch",
    p: "One story walkable is the easy end. Two stories and a steep pitch means more fall protection and slower work all day.",
  },
  {
    h: "Racking and rails",
    p: "Some older rail systems cannot be safely reused. If yours is one of them, new rails go on the quote as their own line.",
  },
  {
    h: "Permit and inspection",
    p: "Florida counties treat a reinstall as new work. Fees and the inspection visit belong in the price, not as a surprise later.",
  },
