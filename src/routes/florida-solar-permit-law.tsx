  {
    q: "Can my roofer remove my solar panels in Florida?",
    a: "Not legally, unless that roofing company also holds a solar contractor or electrical contractor licence, and most do not. Under Florida's contractor law the installation, alteration, repair, relocation and replacement of solar panels and the equipment that goes with them is solar contracting work. Taking an array off a roof and putting it back is exactly that. A roofing licence does not cover it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a permit to remove and reinstall solar panels?",
    a: "For the reinstall, yes, in practically every Florida county. Putting the array back means new structural attachments through a roof and reconnecting a system that feeds the grid, so the county treats it as new work: permit, plan, inspection. The permit can only be pulled by a licensed solar contractor or electrical contractor.",
  },
  {
    q: "What licence should I be looking for?",
    a: "A certified solar contractor licence, or a certified electrical contractor licence. Ask for the number, then look it up on the state licence search. Any legitimate contractor hands the number over without hesitating. Someone who talks around the question is telling you the answer.",
  },
  {
    q: "What actually goes wrong if an unlicensed crew does it?",
    a: "Four things, and they tend to arrive together. The panel and inverter manufacturers can refuse warranty claims on equipment that was reinstalled by an unlicensed contractor. The roofer will not warranty a roof with penetrations he did not make and cannot inspect. The county can red-tag an unpermitted reinstall, which surfaces when you sell the house. And your insurer can push back on a claim for a system that was never permitted.",
  },
  {
    q: "The roofer says he does it all the time. Is that fine?",
    a: "It is common, and it is still not allowed. A cottage industry of unlicensed crews has grown up around solar removal in Florida precisely because so many roofs now have panels on them. It usually looks fine on the day. The problems arrive later, at a warranty claim, a home sale or a leak.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a small repair need a permit too?",
    a: "Swapping a like-for-like part on an existing permitted system often does not. Anything that changes the structural attachments, the wiring, or the way the system connects to the grid usually does. When we quote, we tell you which side of that line your job falls on before we start.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who pulls the permit, me or you?",
    a: "We do. We pull the solar permit, we file the paperwork, and we meet the inspector. You do not have to take a day off for a county appointment.",
  },

            Why a roofing licence does not cover panels
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base text-muted-foreground">
            Florida's contractor law defines solar contracting as the installation, alteration,
            repair, maintenance, relocation or replacement of solar panels and the equipment that
            goes with them. Lifting an array off a roof and setting it back down is relocation and
            replacement in the same job. That is solar work by definition, whoever is holding the
            wrench.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base text-muted-foreground">
            There is an electrical side too. Disconnecting a grid-tied array from the utility, even
            for a few days, and reconnecting it afterwards is electrical work. It needs an active
            licence. A roofing licence is a licence to build roofs, and it stops at the panel.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-base text-muted-foreground">
            So the reinstall needs a permit, and in Florida that permit can only be pulled by a
            licensed solar contractor or a licensed electrical contractor. If nobody pulled a
            permit on your job, nobody licensed did the work.
