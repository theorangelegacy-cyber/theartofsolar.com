            Art of Solar is a private, highly experienced installer specializing in residential
            photovoltaic, pool and hot water systems. Artem specializes in re-racks: taking solar
            arrays down for roof work and putting them back up right, and repairing the systems
            that other companies walked away from. He works directly with homeowners, and with
            roofers and installers who need a solar crew on their jobs.

            Art of Solar, LLC has been Artem's company since 2020, based in Broward County. Before
            that he spent years on the roofs and in the homes for the big names, installing for
            Namaste Solar and selling for ADT Solar and Vivint Solar. He has seen exactly how the
            fast-growth companies build, which is why he knows where to look when yours fails.
