const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What does detach and reset mean?",
    a: "It is the roofing trade's name for taking a solar array off a roof before tear-off and putting it back after the new roof passes inspection. Same job as removal and reinstall, different word. If it is on a supplement or an insurance scope, it is usually written as solar detach and reset, or D and R.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why can my crew not just do it?",
    a: "Florida treats moving an array as solar contracting, and reconnecting it to the grid as electrical work. Neither is inside a roofing licence. If your guys do it, the panel warranty, the inverter warranty and your own roof warranty are all exposed, and the reinstall has no permit behind it.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast can you get on a roof?",
    a: "Tell us the tear-off date and we work backwards from it. Detach is normally one day and we aim to be off the roof the day before your crew arrives. Reset happens as soon as the roof passes its final inspection. We do not hold your job hostage.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who pulls the permit?",
    a: "We do, for the solar side. You keep your roofing permit, we carry the solar one, and we meet that inspector ourselves. Two permits, two trades, no overlap and nothing left open on the property record.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you quote the homeowner or me?",
    a: "Whichever you prefer. Some roofers want it inside their number so the homeowner sees one price. Others want us to bill the homeowner directly so it stays off their books. Both are normal, just tell us which on the first call.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will this work on an insurance job?",
    a: "Yes, and it comes up constantly. Solar detach and reset is often a legitimate line on a roof claim, because the array physically has to move for the covered repair to happen. We write our quotes so they can be handed straight to an adjuster without being reworked.",
  },
  {
    q: "What about the old mounts?",
    a: "They go in the skip with the old roof. Every attachment on your new roof is new and flashed by us, so your roof warranty is not sitting on top of somebody else's ten-year-old penetrations.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you poach the homeowner?",
    a: "No. We do solar. You do roofs. We are not going to quote your customer a roof and we are not interested in one. Roofers send us repeat work precisely because that line never gets crossed.",
