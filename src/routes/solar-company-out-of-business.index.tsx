              A solar system carries two different warranties and people lose track of that when the
              installer disappears. The workmanship warranty, which covers the labour and the holes
              in your roof, belonged to the company that closed. That one is gone. The factory
              warranties on the panels, the inverter and the optimizers belong to the manufacturers
              who built them, and those run 10 to 25 years no matter who installed them.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base text-muted-foreground">
              The catch is that manufacturers will not accept a warranty claim from a homeowner. It
              has to come from a licensed solar contractor with the serial numbers and a written
              diagnosis. That is the piece we do, and it is why the repair often costs far less than
              people expect.
