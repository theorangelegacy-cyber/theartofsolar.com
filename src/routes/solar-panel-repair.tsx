const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Do you repair solar panels you did not install?",
    a: "Almost everything we repair was installed by somebody else, including companies that no longer exist. Any brand of panel, any inverter, any racking. We are not going to tell you a system is unsupported because our name is not on it.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does solar panel repair cost in Florida?",
    a: "A diagnostic visit is a fixed fee and it comes with a written list of what is actually wrong. Small work like a tripped breaker, a bad connector or a failed optimizer usually lands in the low hundreds. An inverter replacement is the big one, and how big depends on whether the unit is still inside its manufacturer warranty. You get the number in writing before anyone starts.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast can somebody get out here?",
    a: "For most of the route from Orlando to Miami we are talking days, not weeks. Tell us the town and what the system is doing and you get a real date on the first call rather than a place on a list.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my warranty worth anything if the installer closed?",
    a: "Usually yes. The workmanship warranty from the installer normally dies with the company, but the manufacturer warranties on the panels, the inverter and the optimizers are separate and often still live. We file those claims for you, which is frequently the difference between a few hundred dollars and a few thousand.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a broken panel be repaired, or does it have to be replaced?",
    a: "A panel with cracked glass or a burnt junction box gets replaced, because there is no safe repair for that. Most of what people call a broken panel is not the panel at all. It is the wiring, the optimizer or the connector behind it, and that is repairable. We test before we condemn anything.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a solar repair need a permit?",
    a: "A like-for-like repair usually does not. Replacing an inverter, changing the racking or moving panels usually does, and in Broward and Miami-Dade the attachment rules are stricter again. We tell you which side of that line your job sits on, and we pull the permit when it is needed.",
  },
  {
    q: "My roof needs replacing too. What then?",
    a: "Then it is one job, not two. The array comes off for the roofer, the faults get fixed while the panels are on the ground where they are easy to work on, and everything goes back on new flashed mounts. It is the cheapest time to repair anything.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are you licensed?",
    a: "Yes. Moving or reconnecting a solar array in Florida is solar and electrical work, and it sits outside a roofing or handyman licence. Everything we do is done by a licensed and insured crew, permitted where the county requires it, and inspected.",

              Sometimes it is not, and you will hear that from us. A tired array with a dead inverter
              and corroded racking can cost more to nurse along than it will ever save. But that is
              the rare call. The common one is a system that is basically sound with one failed part
              on it, sitting idle while the loan payment goes out every month.
